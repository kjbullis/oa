						"I've been using the leg salsa for years now and I love it. I'd like to talk to you more about the other products and how we can work together in improving your line through rider feedback. Would you be up for a chat sometime soon? Hope to hear from you soon."

						"Breathe Strong works really well ahead of super hard cycling efforts like Time Trials to open up my breathing passages. You just need a small amount on cotton buds and place in nostrils during warm up. It is not the most attractive but it is very effective."
						<p>- Olivia Dillon (Professional Cyclist) </p>

					<blockquote>"Well at a race here in Denmark, I heard a guy talking about your "leg salsa", I talked a bit with him, and he said he had tried all your products, and had only good things to say about it.<br>
						He sad the leg salsa is very easy to wash off after racing. Which sounds good to me, I think it's a bit difficult with the brand I use now.<br>
						<br>
						Also most of his friends uses "smooth ride". I also Googled your company name, and found it mentioned on a Danish website called <a href="http://feltet.dk/" target="_blank">feltet.dk</a>, which is the biggest cycling site in scandinavia."<br>

					<blockquote>"Many years ago, before your company got big, you gave me a jar of the original &#214;&#258;. I think you gave it to me at the Tour De Ney. I have used it diligently to it's last bit and have found its healing properties to be amazing. I've used it on my knees, ankles, and now on my injured tailbone. I also have a jar of the OA leg salsa, which is similar in recipe, but ALOT hotter, and when I put it on my tailbone...well, you know...Any chance you have any of the original stuff around? I looked on your website and I don't see anything like it...
						I think it is healing my tailbone and really need more..."

					<blockquote>"Just ordered the performance package. Leg salsa might be my new favorite embro!!! And the deep tissue balm is way rad.
						Anyways. You've got a new customer."

					<blockquote>"I am a big fan of your product and tell all my fellow cyclists and clients about it. Believe it or not it's been the coldest winter here in Tarpon Springs, Fl, and I really need it as I am completely out as of today...."<br>

					<blockquote>"Hi!    I just wanted to say that I am a big fan of Leg Salsa.  I recently  used it while riding the Adirondack 540  this September. This year's ADK540 was a 540-mile, 30,000-feet-gain  romp through rain, wind and temps into the 20's while on 50MPH  descents. <br>
						To be sure, I wore leg warmers over the Leg Salsa, but I  was really impressed that my legs remained toasty for up to 12 hours after application.  This has become an essential part of my kit on  colder, longer rides and I am looking forward to using it through my  winter training season in inclement Cleveland, OH.    Thanks for the great product!  I will remain a loyal customer."<br>

					<blockquote>"I just wanted to thank you guys for such a great product. I ride for Team Wrong Way and this was my first winter of cycling. I was really  frustrated with my toes and feet getting extremely cold no matter how many socks I wore or whatever I put over my feet. One of my teammates gave me a jar of leg salsa and I'm sold. I rubbed some of it on my toes before my ride and after 2 hours in about 40 F weather, no problems. I'm sold."<br>
						<p>- Matt Leonard</p>

					<blockquote>
						"I'm LOVING this stuff. Thanks for the great service and the leg embro and bottle as well! I used a bit of the embro on my knees last weekend and it too was a home run, it's going to be perfect for CX season here. I just posted up a +1 on your product on the forum I learned about your goods from."

						"I have been using leg salsa for two years, Chris Black hooked me up. I have been doing massage for 26 years. I have tried all the Hot stuff. Still yours is the best for me. I need to get more, thanks!"
						<p>- Kim Bleth LMT </p>

					<blockquote>
						"I bought some of your products while I lived in Santa Ynez and am sadly out. I most often use it on my back and it has capsicum, arnica, st johns wort and essential oil of manuka (among other things) and generates a significant amount of heat.<br>
						Do any stores near Asheville, NC carry it?<br>
						Thanks so much for your time. You have a great product."

						"I use Leg Salsa on every ride, even in the summer months. I know you're saying "why does he use the hot stuff in the summer..??". Well, I ride 3 &ndash; 4 times a week and each ride is between 20 &ndash; 30 miles after work. At 63, I want to keep the legs in good working order and Leg Salsa does that for me. I don't use as much, but it works..!! The Pros ride a stationary trainer before they race, so I use Leg Salsa which loosens the muscles within the first 5 miles especially the knees.
						I even used it in August 2006 when I broke my hip in a cycling accident. Leg Salsa kept the hip nice and loose during the healing process and I was back on the indoor trainer by early December.
						I was just reading Belgium Knee Warmers Blog and their article and feedback on embrocations&hellip;pretty interesting..!! I've used some of the ones mentioned in the past and was not terribly impressed..!!
						I'm probably am not your biggest customer, but I'm certainly your biggest fan..!!
						Thanks again for producing a wonderful product..!!"

						"I ordered these products a few weeks ago and I have to  say I really, really like them. I've  only recently discovered embrocation lotions and my first product was some mild  temperature stuff from Qoleum. I like  your stuff better, and you're local (I race for San Jose Bike Club, <a href="http://www.teamsanjose.org">www.teamsanjose.org</a>). Guys on the team think I'm a little crazy  putting this stuff on during the cold and wet days, but they stop laughing  after seeing how well it works."
						"I used the Leg Salsa for the first time today on our  club's final winter series road race (50 miles, cold, wet) and it didn't  disappoint. It was still keeping me  toasty well after the 2.5 hours of racing.  But buyer beware, don't rub your face...this stuff will make your eyes  tear up if you get it too close!"
						<p>- Todd, San Jose Bike Club</p>

					<blockquote>
						"Even after the nationals a 55-59 year old asked me what I was rubbing in my  legs. I told her it was leg salsa and it  warms up the muscles. I received Alcis  from the two Mermaid Duathlons I've done this year. They give away free samples and they give a  big tube to the winners. Smooth ride is so much better than bag balm. My bike seat is no longer shiny and I don't  leave embarrasing stains when I sit on a bench.  I am running a marathon in MI next weeekend and I will definitely need  the leg salsa to warm up my muscles."

						"I don't leave home without it! I've been using it for years and I wanted to tell you that after using many brands of leg heat, this is the only one that I found that keeps me warm on the chilly and cold rainy days, in fact I feel like I have an advantage when I have on a layer of Leg Salsa."
						"I look forward to using more of your product this winter!"

						"Thank you for your Leg Salsa!!!"

					<blockquote>
						"I placed an order last week with you guys for 6 tubes of Smooth Ride and a small jar of Leg Salsa. I wanted to first let you know that  the items arrived fairly quickly, and I wanted to say thanks for the sample of  the massage balm - I like it quite a lot and I'm sure I'll end up buying more  in the future. What's more, I wanted to thank you guys for making quality  products that you clearly stand behind and have confidence in. I'll continue to  purchase your products so long as I ride a bicycle, which, hopefully, will be a  long time. The quality is top notch, the performance of the products is  fantastic, and the simplistic yet highly effective approach makes them that  much more appealing. Thank you again and I look forward to being a continuous  customer."

					<blockquote>"The OA Pro-Glaze is a product 
						that works for me. It has been a great relief for the recovery of my back 
						problem and a great pre-race warm-up rub for my legs. This is the legal, 
						safe, 100% natural performance enhancer."
						<p>- Trent Klasna, Pro Rider </p>

					<blockquote>"I purchased the Leg Salsa several weeks ago and my experience has been 
						unbelievable. I am an ice marathon speedskater (4 time US National Champion, 
						2 Time North American Champion) and the Leg Salsa is ideal for cold 
						winter conditions especially when skating distances up to 200k in frigid 
						temperatures. The Leg Salsa's deep penetrating heat keeps my muscles 
						warm not only during the race but even into the recovery hours!"
						"Thanks again for creating such an awesome product! I can't wait to try the Pro Glaze during the cycling 
						season."
						<p>- Rob Kramer, Okolo Sports Ice Speedskating Marathon Team</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>"I tried the Leg Salsa and I love it! I have lower back problems 
						due to a recovering from a back injury (on the mends) and it really 
						helps with loosening and keeping warm (during those cold rides) my lower 
						back muscles. I've been using Qoleum for the past few years and 
						I didn't think I find something else comparable, but I have in 
						your Leg Salsa. In 2003, I ventured in trying Sixtufit and wasn't 
						thrilled with it. Thanks for a great product, of which I'm glad 
						to plug!" 
						<p>- Cathy Wong, President, Le Peloton F&eacute;minin </p>

					<blockquote>"WOW, &#214;&#258; Pro Glaze works immediately on severe muscle pain. Recently, 
						I got a sudden attack of terrible muscle pain which came out of the 
						blue and did not let up for a week. Continuous pain wears you down. 
						I tried EVERYTHING including all the pain killers. Luckily, through 
						Brent Winters, my husband got some &#214;&#258;, massaged it in for about 10 minutes 
						every couple of hours and &#214;&#258; brought immediate relief which lasted longer 
						than ANY other product."

						"Thanks for the recent shipment.  It was just in time, as the cooler, wet weather has arrived with 'cross season.  I actually used quite a bit of leg salsa for the last road race of my season, the Green Mountain stage race.  We started a long mountain stage with a descent from a ski area in the rain, so I even put some on my lower back.  It was great towards the end of the race. Thanks also for the massage cream.  I like it better than the massage bars."

					<blockquote>
						"How did I hear about Leg Salsa?  One of the guys on my cycling team (Whole Wheel Velo Club, <a href="http://www.wwvc.org" target="_blank">www.wwvc.org</a>) talks about Leg Salsa the way some others talk about Angelina Jolie.  So, I thought I better 'get me some of that!"

					<blockquote>"I got some leg salsa last year when one of the guys I worked with just happened to find it when we were looking for a new race leg prep. It sounded like it had to be good.  And, lucky for me it work as good as it sounded. I also like the all good and no bad ingredients.Your products are not easy to find. I have worked in the bike industry for some time, 8 1/2 years with Specialized and currently am the Inside Sales Manager for Bike at Fox Racing - the clothing interested. All of our Bike reps are independent.Keep up the good work.      
						Oh yeah I forgot to mention...Leg Salsa is the balm!"

						"Just a quick note on how fantastic your Leg Salsa and your Pro Glaze are - I am now in my 40's, have had two back surgeries and a knee surgery, so I started trying out various embrocations to see if they would help physiologically or phsychologically, I really didn't care which.
						In addition, living in Colorado, where the possibility of biking almost year around is dangled in front of you (as long as you don't mind the cold) also motivated me.  I mix the Salsa and Glaze in different concentrations throughout the year based on air temperature and thecondition of my body at the time.
						I tried pretty much everything out there, with your products right in the middle of those try-outs.  I mean, I sampled everything;  euro instituions to smaller american start-ups like yours.  Your products are by far the best I have tried.  Not only for the warming psych-factor, but also seemed to keep my knees and back from hurting so much the next day.  It is safe to say that I bike more and farther because of your Salsa and Glaze.  And they had the least cloying odor, the least grandma-like of them all.<br>
						<br>
						Seriously, thanks!"
