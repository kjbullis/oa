								<p>&quot;Breathe Strong works really well ahead of super hard cycling efforts like Time Trials to open up my breathing passages. You just need a small amount on cotton buds and place in nostrils during warm up. It is not the most attractive but it is very effective.&quot;</p>

									&quot;Well at a race here in Denmark, I heard a guy talking about your "leg salsa", I talked a bit with him, and he said he had tried all your products, and had only good things to say about it.&nbsp;<br>
									He sad the leg salsa is very easy to wash off after racing. Which sounds good to me, I think it's a bit difficult with the brand I use now.&nbsp;<br>
									<br>
									Also most of his friends uses "smooth ride". I also  googled your company name, and found it mentioned on a danish website called&nbsp;<a href="http://feltet.dk/" target="_blank">feltet.dk</a>, which is the biggest cycling site in scandinavia.&quot;<br>

								<p> &quot;Many years ago, before your&nbsp;company got big, you gave me a jar of the original OA.&nbsp;I think you gave it to me at the Tour De Ney.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have used it diligently to it's last bit and have found its healing properties to be amazing. I've used it on my knees, ankles, and now on my injured tailbone.&nbsp; I also have a jar of the OA leg salsa, which is similar in recipe, but ALOT hotter, and when I put it on my tailbone...well, you know...&nbsp;Any chance you have any of the original stuff around?&nbsp; I looked on your website and I don't see anything like it...</p>
								<p>I think it is healing my tailbone and really need more...&quot;</p>

								<p>&quot;Hi!    I just wanted to say that I am a big fan of Leg Salsa.  I recently  used it while riding the Adirondack 540  this September. This year's ADK540 was a 540-mile, 30,000-feet-gain  romp through rain, wind and temps into the 20's while on 50MPH  descents. <br>
									To be sure, I wore leg warmers over the Leg Salsa, but I  was really impressed that my legs remained toasty for up to 12 hours after application.  This has become an essential part of my kit on  colder, longer rides and I am looking forward to using it through my  winter training season in inclement Cleveland, OH.    Thanks for the great product!  I will remain a loyal customer.&quot;<br>

								<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">&quot;I just wanted to thank you guys for such a great product. I ride for Team Wrong Way and this was my first winter of cycling. I was really  frustrated with my toes and feet getting extremely cold no matter how many socks I wore or whatever I put over my feet. One of my teammates gave me a jar of leg salsa and I'm sold. I rubbed some of it on my toes before my ride and after 2 hours in about 40 F weather, no problems. I'm sold.&quot;</font><font face="Trebuchet MS"><br>

									<p>&quot;I bought some of your products while I lived in Santa Ynez and am sadly out. I most often use it on my back and it has capsicum, arnica, st johns wort and essential oil of manuka (among other things) and generates a significant amount of heat.&nbsp;<br>
										Do any stores near asheville, NC carry it?<br>
										Thanks so much for your time.&nbsp; You have a great product.&quot;</p>

									<p align="left">&quot;I use Leg Salsa on every ride, even in the summer months.&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;re saying &ldquo;why does he use the hot stuff in the summer..??&rdquo;.&nbsp; Well, I ride 3 &ndash; 4 times a week and each ride is between 20 &ndash; 30 miles after work.&nbsp; At 63, I want to keep the legs in good working order and Leg Salsa does that for me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t use as much, but it works..!!&nbsp; The Pros ride a stationary trainer before they race, so I use Leg Salsa which loosens the muscles within the first 5 miles especially the knees.</p>
									<p align="left">I even used it in August 2006 when I broke my hip in a cycling accident.&nbsp; Leg Salsa kept the hip nice and loose during the healing process and I was back on the indoor trainer by early December.</p>

								<p>&quot;I ordered these products a few weeks ago and I have to  say I really, really like them.&nbsp; I've  only recently discovered embrocation lotions and my first product was some mild  temperature stuff from Qoleum.&nbsp; I like  your stuff better, and you're local (I race for San Jose Bike Club, <a href="http://www.teamsanjose.org">www.teamsanjose.org</a>).&nbsp; Guys on the team think I'm a little crazy  putting this stuff on during the cold and wet days, but they stop laughing  after seeing how well it works.&quot;</p>
								<p>&quot;I used the Leg Salsa for the first time today on our  club's final winter series road race (50 miles, cold, wet) and it didn't  disappoint.&nbsp; It was still keeping me  toasty well after the 2.5 hours of racing.&nbsp;  But buyer beware, don't rub your face...this stuff will make your eyes  tear up if you get it too close!&quot;</p>

								<p>&quot;Even after the nationals a
									55-59 year old asked me what I was rubbing in my  legs.&nbsp; I told her it was leg salsa and it  warms up the muscles.&nbsp; I received Alcis  from the two Mermaid Duathlons I've done this year.&nbsp; They give away free samples and they give a  big tube to the winners. Smooth ride is so much better than bag balm.&nbsp; My bike seat is no longer shiny and I don't  leave embarrasing stains when I sit on a bench.&nbsp;  I am running a marathon in MI next weeekend and I will definitely need  the leg salsa to warm up my muscles.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&quot;I placed an order last week with you guys for 6 tubes of  Smooth Ride and a small jar of Leg Salsa. I wanted to first let you know that  the items arrived fairly quickly, and I wanted to say thanks for the sample of  the massage balm - I like it quite a lot and I'm sure I'll end up buying more  in the future. What's more, I wanted to thank you guys for making quality  products that you clearly stand behind and have confidence in. I'll continue to  purchase your products so long as I ride a bicycle, which, hopefully, will be a  long time. The quality is top notch, the performance of the products is  fantastic, and the simplistic yet highly effective approach makes them that  much more appealing. Thank you again and I look forward to being a continuous  customer.&quot;</p>

						I tried EVERYTHING including all the pain killers. Luckily, through 
						Bret Winters, my husband got some OA, massaged it in for about 10 minutes

					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS">In addition, living in Colorado, where the possibility of biking almost year around is dangled in front of you (as long as you don't mind the cold) also motivated me.

					<p><font face="Trebuchet MS"> I tried pretty much everything out there, with your products right in the middle of those try-outs.  I mean, I sampled everything;  euro instituions to smaller american start-ups like yours.  Your products are by far the best I have tried.  Not only for the warming psych-factor, but also seemed to keep my knees and back from hurting so much the next day.  It is safe to say that I bike more and farther because of your Salsa and Glaze.  And they had the least cloying odor, the least grandma-like of them all.<br>
